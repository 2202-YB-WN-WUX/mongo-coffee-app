<h1>MongoDB Refresh</h1>

- This is a refresh of MongoDB - our coffee app

- Rename the config-example.json file to config.json, and add your MongoDB credentials into it before running the app

- Head to MongoDB.com, go to your Database > Connect (next to your cluster name) and get the connection string for your specific cluster

- Replace connection string in **index.js** on line 35 and insert both your credentials from config.json into the username:password area

- To start the app, navigate into the **backend** folder and type in:

```
npm run go
```
